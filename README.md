# Networking-Server-Programs
These Java programming examples, I explored both TCP and UDP client-server communication. 

For TCP,
  We have a client that connects to a server, exchanges messages, and closes the connection, while the server listens, greets clients, and processes their messages. For UDP, 
  The client sends a number to the server, receives calculations of its square and cube, and displays the results. The server, in turn, receives numbers, computes results, and sends them back. 
  
-> These programs demonstrate how to establish network communication, showcasing the differences between the reliability of TCP and the simplicity of UDP for data exchange.
